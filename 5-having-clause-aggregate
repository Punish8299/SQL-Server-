SQL HAVING clause is similar to the WHERE clause; they are both used to filter rows in a table based on conditions.

HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions.

the HAVING clause filters the grouped rows.

The HAVING clause must always be followed by the GROUP BY clause.

âž¤ It can also contain multiple conditions to filter the grouped results.

These conditions are separated by various operators like AND, OR etc.

EX
select from EMP_Test

Eselect JOB, sum(sal), count (EMPNO) as Total_Emp

from EMP Test

where job is not null

group by JOB

Having sum(sal) between 2000 and 5000

order by Total_Emp;
